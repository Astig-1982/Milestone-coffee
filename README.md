# Coffee Project

Coffee-Project is a website of a fictional company 'Coffee Fresh' that delivers coffee to the workplace. 

## UX

### Project Goals: 

  Coffee Fresh is looking to sell and deliver its products straight to the clients workplace. Its main target are companies, rather than a physical person. 
  The company operates on a monthly basis subscription. Through this website the prospective clients can simply register and choose from one or more of the three brands of speciality coffee provided by 'Coffee Fresh'.
  The webbsite helps the company by providing the users an easy and intuitive way to register. It provides details regarding the products and a short description of the company's offerings.

## Design Choices:

 The theme of this project is delivering speciality coffee to the workplace and the main target are the offices. Therefore I have chosen a neutral color pattern thrughout to highlight a proffessional environment.

### Fonts:

I chose to use [ARIAL](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/arial?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts) for the main title in order to keep a simple and proffessional appearance as a first encounter the user will have with the website.

I chose to use [POPPINS](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as a main font for the webiste as it is a very clear and minimalistic font that can be easily read by the user. This will be very helpful especially when the prospective clients will read about the company, offering an easy read, without distracting the user from the goal of the project - registering and placing the order.

I chose to use [BASKERVVILLE](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baskervville) for sub-titles and navbar as, in my opinion, it's a bit more artistic font (still easy to read) and could seem a bit more friendly to the reader (user), comparing to a more simplistic and robotic font. The goal is to make the user feel more connected with the company, giving it a sense of familiarity.

The combination of all three fonts used, in my opinion, gives the website a proffessional, clear and in the same time friendly aspect. 

### Icons:

I used the icon bar to display the classic ‘burger-button’ on tablet and mobile devices, this is well known in the industry as being a point for navigation. I used the 'coffee cup' icon from font-awesome for the 'about-us' page in order to highlight in a clear way what the company is selling - coffee.

### Colors:

I have used neutral colors for most of the project as I wanted to keep a proffessional appearance. 

  * Primary: **A Shade Of Light Gray** rgba(191, 182, 166,.9) I chose this as a primary color in order to match with the hero image and give uniformity to the website. I used the specific hero image to highlight the type of clientele expected to navigate the website. Mostly will be offices, hence displaying a simple and suggestive image.

  * Secondary: **Light Brown** rgb(214, 167, 87) I chose this color as it resembles the cream that a quality coffee comes with. It also matches the coffee cream from the hero image and provides a stark contrast with the primary color.

  * Default body color: **White** #ffffff I chose to use white as I wanted to keep a simple and clear appearence for the website. This will make the user more focused on the products and services the company is providing.

### Background:

The images I used in for the website are sourced from royalty free websites and they represent suggestive images of coffee and work being done on a laptop with a creammy coffee next to it. The products' images represent each product and its main use (e.g. the first product is ideal for cappuccinos and lattes, hence the suggestive image with 3 cappuccinos).

## Wireframes:

I built the wireframe for this project using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). First I started with a basic structure and afterwords added the features and products display. During the building of the project I have change my mind severall times regarding the design and made few alterations, therefore the wireframe is slightly different than the final product. You can view my wireframe [here](https://github.com/Astig-1982/Milestone-coffee/blob/master/wireframes/Milestone-Project.pdf).
You can also see the wireframe on gitpod in the 'wireframes' directory.

## Technologies used:

### Languages:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

### Tools & Libraries:

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Testing:

As this was my very first project and website created, my testing was thorough and in detail regarding every aspect. 

### Testing Stories:

* I have tested my **HTML** code using [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). It has found few small errors (like unclosed divs or bootstrap button element nested in anchor tags) which I've corrected immediately. It also issued 2 warnings of lacking headings to 'about-us' and 'products' sections. I have added heading to 'products' section. I left 'about-us' section without heading as I thought this section is pretty much self-explanatory and I wanted to keep a clean and simple design.
* I have tested my **CSS** code using [CSS Validation Service](http://www.css-validator.org/). I am happy to announce it has found no errors.
* I was informed that my hero image (please see it [here](https://esprada.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/books-break-coffee-927451-compressed-pexels-220618-min.jpg)) with which I wanted to submit the project innitally wasn't very suggestive regarding the goal of the website. I've changed it with the current one (please see [here](https://albacoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/OfficeCoffee1.jpg)) from which I had much better feedback, sending a more clear message about what the company is essentially selling - coffee.
* I was informed that my products section wasn't suggestive enough in terms of what this section actually represents. Following this feedback, together with the warning issued by **W3C Validator** regarding lacking of some headings (please see above) I've added the explanatory heading to this section.
* I was advised that using *br* tags (line break) in HTML coding is an old technic and not highly recommended. I have removed all *br* tags and replaced with alternatives (separate divs elements or have completely removed them).
* The div element with the class "head-nav row" from the header section had default margins from bootstrap. Because of this, the entire website was too large to fit in the viewport (for all devices) and it had a horizontal scroll. With the help of [Unicorn Revealer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB) I realised where is the error and set margins to 0 to the respective element.

### Overall:

#### Responsivness:

I knew that the project needed to be fully responsive on all types of screen, especially mobile friendly. In order to accomplish this requirement I used Bootstrap as HTML framework, this option being the one that I'm most comfortable using at the moment. I've carried the testing using dev-tools throughout and a final test after the completion. 

#### Result:

The website is fully responsive as expected, all elements and content fit within their boundaries and are easy to see on any device.
