# The Coffee Project

The-Coffee-Project is a website of a fictional company 'Coffee Fresh' that delivers coffee to the workplace. 

## UX

### Project Goals: 

  Coffee Fresh is looking to sell and deliver its products straight to the clients workplace. Its main target are companies, rather than a physical person. 
  The company operates on a monthly basis subscription. Through this website the prospective clients can simply register and choose from one or more of the three brands of speciality coffee provided by 'Coffee Fresh'.
  The webbsite helps the company by providing the users an easy and intuitive way to register. It provides details regarding the products and a short description of the company's offerings.

### Users Goals:
    
* A website that serves as a tool to order speciality coffee all types of workplaces on a regular basis.

* Visual Interaction which include animated slides.
* Navbar availabe across and throughout all sections for a quick and easy navigation on the website.
* Registry form easy and intuitive for a quick and hassle free registration.
* Responsive interaction with the website on desktop, table and mobile.

* Estimating the demand of their products on a regular basis, depending on the size of the company (how much coffee they can sell per month to a company having an "X" amount of employees).
* Receive contact details through use of contact form. 

## Design Choices:

 The theme of this project is delivering speciality coffee to the workplace and the main target are the offices. Therefore I have chosen a neutral color pattern thrughout to highlight a proffessional environment.

### Fonts:

I chose to use [ARIAL](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/arial?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts) for the main title in order to keep a simple and proffessional appearance as a first encounter the user will have with the website.

I chose to use [POPPINS](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as a main font for the webiste as it is a very clear and minimalistic font that can be easily read by the user. This will be very helpful especially when the prospective clients will read about the company, offering an easy read, without distracting the user from the goal of the project - registering and placing the order.

I chose to use [BASKERVVILLE](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baskervville) for sub-titles and navbar as, in my opinion, it's a bit more artistic font (still easy to read) and could seem a bit more friendly to the reader (user), comparing to a more simplistic and robotic font. The goal is to make the user feel more connected with the company, giving it a sense of familiarity.

The combination of all three fonts used, in my opinion, gives the website a proffessional, clear and in the same time friendly aspect. 

### Icons:

I used the icon bar to display the classic ‘burger-button’ on tablet and mobile devices, this is well known in the industry as being a point for navigation. I used the 'coffee cup' icon from font-awesome for the 'about-us' page in order to highlight in a clear way what the company is selling - coffee.

### Colors:

I have used neutral colors for most of the project as I wanted to keep a proffessional appearance. 

  * Primary: **A Shade Of Light Gray** rgba(191, 182, 166,.9) I chose this as a primary color in order to match with the hero image and give uniformity to the website. I used the specific hero image to highlight the type of clientele expected to navigate the website. Mostly will be offices, hence displaying a simple and suggestive image.

  * Secondary: **Light Brown** rgb(214, 167, 87) I chose this color as it resembles the cream that a quality coffee comes with. It also matches the coffee cream from the hero image and provides a stark contrast with the primary color.

  * Default body color: **White** #ffffff I chose to use white as I wanted to keep a simple and clear appearence for the website. This will make the user more focused on the products and services the company is providing.

### Background:

The images I used in for the website are sourced from royalty free websites and they represent suggestive images of coffee and work being done on a laptop with a creammy coffee next to it. The products' images represent each product and its main use (e.g. the first product is ideal for cappuccinos and lattes, hence the suggestive image with 3 cappuccinos).

## Wireframes:

I built the wireframe for this project using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). First I started with a basic structure and afterwords added the features and products display. During the building of the project I have change my mind severall times regarding the design and made few alterations, therefore the wireframe is slightly different than the final product. You can view my wireframe [here](https://github.com/Astig-1982/Milestone-coffee/blob/master/wireframes/Milestone-Project.pdf).
You can also see the wireframe on gitpod in the 'wireframes' directory.

## Technologies used:

### Languages:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

### Tools & Libraries:

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Testing:

As this was my very first project and website created, my testing was thorough and in detail regarding every aspect. 

### Testing Stories:

* I have tested my **HTML** code using [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). It has found few small errors (like unclosed divs or bootstrap button element nested in anchor tags) which I've corrected immediately. It also issued 2 warnings of lacking headings to 'about-us' and 'products' sections. I have added heading to 'products' section. I left 'about-us' section without heading as I thought this section is pretty much self-explanatory and I wanted to keep a clean and simple design.
* I have tested my **CSS** code using [CSS Validation Service](http://www.css-validator.org/). I am happy to announce it has found no errors.
* I was informed that my hero image (please see it [here](https://esprada.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/books-break-coffee-927451-compressed-pexels-220618-min.jpg)) with which I wanted to submit the project innitally wasn't very suggestive regarding the goal of the website. I've changed it with the current one (please see [here](https://albacoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/OfficeCoffee1.jpg)) from which I had much better feedback, sending a more clear message about what the company is essentially selling - coffee.
* I was informed that my products section wasn't suggestive enough in terms of what this section actually represents. Following this feedback, together with the warning issued by **W3C Validator** regarding lacking of some headings (please see above) I've added the explanatory heading to this section.
* I was advised that using *br* tags (line break) in HTML coding is an old technic and not highly recommended. I have removed all *br* tags and replaced with alternatives (separate divs elements or have completely removed them).
* I notice that the image for the second item at products (Blackcode Espresso) is too large (2,910,746 bytes), which would've slowed down the website's page speed and consequently influenced in a negative way the users's experience. Using [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) I've reduced the size to 513,706 bytes.

### Overall:

#### Responsivness:

I knew that the project needed to be fully responsive on all types of screen, especially mobile friendly. In order to accomplish this requirement I used Bootstrap as HTML framework, this option being the one that I'm most comfortable using at the moment. I've carried the testing using dev-tools throughout and a final test after the completion. 

#### Result:

The website is fully responsive as expected, all elements and content fit within their boundaries and are easy to see on any device.

## Features:

* Animated products display
* Scroll Website
* Fixed Navbar
* Form Validation
* Burger Menu for mobile and tablets

### Animated products display:

I decided to use the sliding animation at products section to make the website a bit more interactive and in the same time I believe it provides an easy way for the user to read few essentials details about each product.

#### Implementation:

I used standard CSS code to make the slide active using the transition property and modifying height property of the sliding element at hover. Regarding the transition duration, after few tests I've decided that .5s is optimal. It provides a nice and smooth effect and in the same time is also practical for the user.

### Scroll Website:

Having only three products for the time being and offering a very straight forward service - essentially selling coffee - I thought the best approach for this project is to do a one page webiste. In this way it will be simpler and clearer for the user to navigate through the website's features and it provides easy access to the register form (from where you can place the order).

#### Implementation:

It was wasy to make this project a scrolling website by simply creating 5 sections (landing page, about-us section, products section, contact-us section and company details plus social links section). All the sections can be easily access from anywhere on the website using the fixed navbar menu or severall internal links and call to action buttons).

### Fixed Navbar:

I thought about it as an easy way to navigate to the main sections from anywhere you currently are on the site. This makes for a better user experience and a quicker way for the user to register.

### Form Validation:

Including some sort of form validation on the contact form is essential as - among others - helps the user not to miss sending important data about him/her self and making the order or even the delivery (of the product) proccess take longer that expected.

#### Implementation:

I've implemented this feature by adding the 'required' attributte to the form in HTML5. This was very simple and worked as expected. 

### Burger Menu for mobile and tablets:

In order to enhance the experience for mobile and tablet users, I planned to include a common burger menu, which is preety much standard in the industry.

#### Implementation:

Using **Bootstrap** in HTML5 was the easiest way to implement this feature. Afterwords I've modified the color and the position (floating right instead of displaying it in the center), overriding the Bootstrap default with simple CSS.

## Bugs:

During the development of this project I was fortunate enought not to encounter many bugs. One annoyng bug that I had to deal with is the one listed below:

### Unexpected horizontal scroll:

* The div element with the class "head-nav row" from the header section had default margins from bootstrap. Because of this, the entire website was too large to fit in the viewport (for all devices) and it had a horizontal scroll. With the help of [Unicorn Revealer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB) I realised where is the error and set margins to 0 to the respective element.

### Known Bug:

* There is a bug at IOS mobiles' and tablets' devices. The navbar is fixed, but for whatever reason it shows up in the middle of the viewport. This affects the landing page section. None of the other sections are affected, the rest works as expected, but with the navbar in the middle. When using DevTools to simulate how the site is responsive on all devices everything works as expected, there is no sign of the respective bug. As well, the bug doesn't affect android devices, everything seems to be working as expected. Only on IOS. I am working to fix the bug and I am quite confident I will sort it out asap.

There are no others known bugs.
